- 👋 Hi, I’m @SooMash, a frontend software engineer, engineering team lead, and product manager. A Mechanical Engineer by training, made the switch to software developement in the venture-building space mid-2021, and haven't looked back!
- 👀 I’m currently focusing on frontend development, but my competitive edge is my product and managerial experience.
- 👷‍♂️ In my technical capacity I specialise in React, ReactNative, TypeScript, CSS, HTML, SASS, Bootstrap, Tailwind, MaterialUI, Redux, Axios, Unit tests, SonarLint, GitHub Actions, SEO optimisation, Accessibility standards, and more.
- 👨🏻‍💼 On the leadership side, my skillset revolves around both a practical and intuitive understanding of business requirements and how those translate to technical specifications. All the while, its teams of humans that make that all happen, and I know how to nurture, encourage, and lead teams of those people with dignity and respect.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 1) commercial-grade AI tooling to supplement engineering outcomes 2) the basics behind backend development, database management, SQL queries, API setup & architecture, 3) and all the while I am engaging with product management & product strategy learnings in the context of my ever-present entrepreneurial mindset.
- 💞️ I’m VERY passionate about renewable energy and the power technology can have to accelarate the transition from non-renewables. Other passions of mine are sustainable food systems, education, and how sociology fits into all of the above.
